Building Sireum
===============

**Requirement: Java 8**

1. Run setup script: `./setup.sh`

2. Run sbt: `tools/bin/sbt`

See [sbt's documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/index.html) for
more information on how to build and test Sireum.


Eclipse
=======

To resolve sireum-build Eclipse project dependency, run `tools/bin/sbt-init` 
instead of `tools/bin/sbt` at least once.
